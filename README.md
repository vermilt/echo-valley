# echoValley Spotify Playlist Builder

 This is a web app that allows users to search for songs using the Spotify API and create playlists. Users can search for tracks, view search results, and save the tracks to their playlists. The app is built using React and Spotify's Web API. This was built as part of my ongoing studies with the codecademy Web Development course.

 ## Features

 - Search Spotify's music catalog for tracks, albums, and artists.
 - Create playlists by selecting tracks from the search results.
 - Save the playlist to your Spotify account.
 - Log in to Spotify using the OAuth 2.0 implicit grant flow for authentication.

 ## Technologies Used
 - Javascript
 - React
 - Spotify Web API
 - CSS
 - HTTP Requests and Responses
 - Authentication

 ## Future Work

  - Improve the mobile layout and configuration of the results and playlist components.
  - Adding more User friendly features, such as a loading symbol, highlighted songs once clicked.
